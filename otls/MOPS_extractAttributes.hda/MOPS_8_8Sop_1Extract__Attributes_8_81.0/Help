"""Creates Houdini point instancing attributes from MOPs Packed Primitives."""

This is a low-level node intended to help artists develop their own MOPs modifiers. 
The Extract Attributes node takes MOPs packed primitives and converts their packed primitive intrinsic attributes into standard Houdini instancing attributes (p@orient, v@scale, @pscale, etc.)
The extracted attributes are written directly to the points representing the packed primitives.

This operator generates the following point attributes: p@orient, v@scale, v@N, v@up, v@pivot

@inputs

Input MOPs Primitives:
    The MOPs primitives to extract instancing attributes from.
