"""Aligns packed primitives and/or their pivots."""

MOPs Align can modify the positions and pivots of packed primitives to align them based on their underlying bounding boxes.
This means you can have them all scale up from their lowest point in Y, for example, without having to manually set the pivots of
each of the instances in the MOPs Instancer.

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    The packed primitives to transform.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Use Falloff:
    #id: do_falloff
    
    Enable the `mops_falloff` attribute. This means that any adjustments you make to pivots or positions will be influenced by the falloff value.

Pivots Only:
    #id: pivots_only
    If enabled, the pivots of the packed primitives will be adjusted without modifying their positions in space.
    
Align To:
    #id: mode
    Choose the bounding box axis to align primitives to.
