"""Moves instances according multiple types of noise fields."""

This node is a replacement for the MOPs Curl Noise modifier. MOPs Noise Modifier can push objects along a curl noise field, but it can
also use many other types of noise fields as well. Objects can be pushed along in their local space (based on their N or up vectors), or
they can be pushed in world space, depending on the Noise Signature.
